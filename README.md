# Tensorflow_LinearModel
A linear model uses a single weighted sum of features to make a prediction. For example, if you have data on age, years of education, and weekly hours of work for a population, you can learn weights for each of those numbers so that their weighted sum estimates a person's salary. You can also use linear models for classification.  Some linear models transform the weighted sum into a more convenient form. For example, logistic regression plugs the weighted sum into the logistic function to turn the output into a value between 0 and 1. But you still just have one weight for each input feature.
